## UX

### Project Goals

Create a project plan that outlines my project idea and the elements required to complete it.  
Learn additional material based on the above and develop a deeper understanding of the material already covered in the course.  
Understand the process of developing a Django app in a Docker container and then implement it.  
Develop an application that is easy to use and meets the needs of the target audience and one which is aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to all users/visitors.  
Purposefully implement a database design suitable for the application.  
Produce a project that fulfills the requirements of the Milestone project criteria.  
Produce a project that I am proud of.
